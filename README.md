# Weather_Forecast_App
This is a weather forecast app developed during the Android App. Dev. training with Kotlin. Shows the Current Weather for a specific city, forecast for the next 24 hours every three hours, air quality, add and remove favourite cities. I've used openweathermap.org to fetch the data that I needed.
